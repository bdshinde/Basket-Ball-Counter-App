# Basket-Ball-Counter-App
Built Basketball Counter App Using HTML CSS and JavaScript 
This project was assignment for what I had learnt on Scrimba.com at basic level.

1. By clicking on add buttons we can add numbers ranging from 1 to 3 to the scoreboard for two teams.
2. We can also use RESET button to reset the scores to zero.
3. There are functions written in ScoreCard.jss which gets invoked when we click on these buttons
